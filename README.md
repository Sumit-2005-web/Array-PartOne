# Java Array Operations 🧮

This repository contains a basic Java program that demonstrates fundamental array operations. The operations covered include:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Reversing an Array
- Printing All Pairs in an Array
- Printing All Subarrays

## 📁 File Structure

- `PartOne.java` – Contains all the implementations for array operations.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 1. Linear Search
Finds the index of a target element by checking each element sequentially.

### 2. Binary Search
Efficiently finds the index of a target element in a **sorted** array using a divide-and-conquer approach.

### 3. Reverse Array
Reverses the order of elements in an array.

### 4. Print All Pairs
Prints all possible pairs of elements in the array.

### 5. Print All Subarrays
Prints all contiguous subarrays that can be formed from the array.

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

```bash
javac PartOne.java
java PartOne
